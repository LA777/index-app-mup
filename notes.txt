Write a program (it can be console, web, Windows form, etc..) to query the REST endpoint and calculate the following:

1.      The year which saw the highest attendance – if there are ties, display the earliest year
2.      The year with highest overall GPA
3.      Top 10 students with highest overall GPA
4.      Student with the largest difference between their minimum and maximum GPA

Try to keep your implementation clean.  Core of the application must be written in C#.  We expect the submission to include unit tests.
